# AI-Generated-Portfolio-Website-from-Resume
creating a portfolio from user's resume
- An end-to-end AI-powered application that converts a resume (PDF or DOCX) into a professional,     responsive portfolio website automatically.
- This project demonstrates how LangChain and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to build      real-world automation pipelines — from document parsing to frontend code generation.
# Project Overview :
- Creating a personal portfolio website usually requires:
- Frontend development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Design sense
- Time to manually structure resume details
- This project solves that problem by allowing users to upload a resume and instantly receive a fully generated portfolio website with production-ready code.
# key Features:
- Upload resume in PDF or DOCX format
- AI-powered resume understanding
- Automatic generation of:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- One-click ZIP download
- Clean and simple Streamlit UI
- Fully automated end-to-end workflow
# How It Works (Step-by-Step) :
- User uploads a resume (PDF or DOCX)
- Resume content is extracted using document parsers
- LLM #1 analyzes the resume and creates a structured website specification
- LLM #2 generates complete frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Files are bundled into a ZIP archive
- User downloads the ready-to-deploy portfolio website
